# Going low level with TCP sockets and `:gen_tcp`

---

## Summary

TCP sockets are used everywhere, though most of the time the details are hidden in high-level APIs and protocols. However, the BEAM makes writing such low-level network code a breeze — this talk will give a brief overview of how Erlang’s built-in `:gen_tcp` can be used to build low-level client and server applications.

The audience should be already familiar with Elixir code and some core BEAM concepts such as processes and messages.

## Why bother?

* Foundation of the Internet
* At the base of most [^1] of all network-related code
* Will make you wonder how everything even *works*
* Will make you appreciate the engineers that designed it

[^1]: UDP is the other major one

## Internet Protocol (IP in TCP/IP)

* Like passing notes in school
* Put data in a packet, pass it on
* Optionally, put the packet in an envelope
* Hope for the best

---

## Internet Protocol (IP in TCP/IP) (cont'd)

* How do you know that your packet arrived at the destination? [^2]
* What happens if your data won't fit the packet?
* If you have multiple packets, how do you guarantee order?
* etc.

## TCP/IP

* Gives you a **point-to-point**, **two-way stream** abstraction on top of the chaos
* Make a connection to the other party
* Write data to your end, appears on the other end
* and vice-versa

## BSD Sockets API

* Most common TCP/IP API
* Breaks the illusion slightly, adapting to real-life concerns
* Read buffer, write buffer, flushing, blocking etc.

---

## `:gen_tcp`

* Exposes a BSD Socket API in the BEAM, via a port
* Blocking mode (passive)
* Non-blocking mode (active)

---

## Hello world (request)

```elixir
{:ok, socket} = :gen_tcp.connect('www.google.com', 80,
                                    [:binary, active: false], 5000)
:ok = :gen_tcp.send(socket, "GET / HTTP/1.0 \r\n\r\n")
{:ok, response} = :gen_tcp.recv(socket, 0, 5000)
IO.puts response
```


---

## Hello world (response)

```

## Connect

```elixir
{:ok, socket} = :gen_tcp.connect('www.google.com', 80,
                                    [:binary, active: false], 5000)
```

* Blocks -- *always use timeout!*
* Hostname is a **charlist**
* List argument is options (huge!)
* `:binary` means response should be a binary (vs charlist)
* `active: false` means use passive/blocking mode

---

## Send

```elixir
:ok = :gen_tcp.send(socket, "GET / HTTP/1.0 \r\n\r\n")
```

* Send binary data (`iodata`)
* No send timeout -- global socket `send_timeout` option [^3]

[^3]: timeouts will be discussed later

---

## Receive

```elixir
{:ok, response} = :gen_tcp.recv(socket, 0, 5000)
```

* Blocks -- *always use timeout!*
* Must specify how much data to read??
* How should **I** know?
* What does "read zero data" even *mean?*

{:ok, socket} = :gen_tcp.connect('www.gutenberg.org', 80,
                                  [:binary, active: false])
:ok = :gen_tcp.send(socket,
                    ["GET /files/84/84-0.txt HTTP/1.1\r\n",
                    "Host: www.gutenberg.org\r\n",
                    "Accept: */*\r\n\r\n"])
{:ok, response} = :gen_tcp.recv(socket, 0, 5000)
IO.puts response
IO.puts "Received #{byte_size(response)} bytes"
```

## Stream abstraction breakdown

* The OS maintains its own receiving and sending buffers
* As packets come in from the network, they are written there
* The BSD socket API reads and writes from/to these buffers
* As our code reads from the buffer, room is made for new data
* Small responses may fit entirely in the buffer -- **confusion!**
* Need a way to know when sender is done sending

---

## Enter protocols

* Pre-agreed ways of controlling communications.
* e.g. for HTTP requests, end with two `CRLF`: 
    `"GET / HTTP/1.0 \r\n\r\n"`
* e.g. for HTTP responses, close the connection:

```[.highlight: 7]
$ telnet google.com 80
GET / HTTP/1.0

HTTP/1.0 302 Found
... snip ...
</BODY></HTML>
Connection closed by foreign host.
```

---

## Shared understanding

* What should I expect?
* How big is the payload?
* What happens next?

## Recap

* IP is an unreliable, packet-based transport
* TCP is a reliable, stream-based layer over IP
* Protocols give meaning to the stream

---

## Back to the code

---

## Passive, or, "non-active mode"

* Blocking API
* Direct flow control (what happens next)
* Very similar to other languages
* Must spawn a dedicate process

---

## Active mode

* Receive data and events as messages

```elixir
def hello do
  {:ok, socket} = :gen_tcp.connect('www.google.com', 80,
                                   [:binary, active: true])
  :ok = :gen_tcp.send(socket, "GET / HTTP/1.0 \r\n\r\n")
  recv()
end
```

---

```elixir
def recv do
  receive do
    {:tcp, socket, msg} ->
        IO.puts msg
        recv()
    {:tcp_closed, socket} -> 
        IO.puts "=== Closed ==="
    {:tcp_error, socket, reason} -> 
        IO.puts "=== Error #{inspect reason} ==="
  end
end
```
